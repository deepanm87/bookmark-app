Built an app that allows a user to view, delete and add bookmarks of sites to visit and also stores their fav icon.

It implements local storage to save a snapshot of saved bookmarks on your local web browser.

It only takes valid URLs and adds http or https if user doesn't add it and doesn't accept empty values.
